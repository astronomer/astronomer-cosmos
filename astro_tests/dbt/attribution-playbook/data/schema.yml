      Sessions are discrete periods of activity by a user on a website. The industry standard
      is to define a session as a series of activities followed by a 30-minute window without
      any activity.

      Use a dbt package to turn pageviews into sessions.

      - name: customer_id

          Typically, some sessions will not have a customer_id associated with them. For this
          playbook, we've limited data to sessions with known customer_ids.
