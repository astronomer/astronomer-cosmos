## `jaffle_shop`

`jaffle_shop` is a fictional ecommerce store. This dbt project transforms raw data from an app database into a customers and orders model ready for analytics.

See [dbt's documentation](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop) for more info.

### Modifications

This project has been modified from the original to highlight some of the features of Cosmos. Namely:

- tags have been added to the models
- the following models were replaced:
  - `models/orders.sql` by `models/orders.py`
  - `models/customers.sql` by `models/customers.py`
- the `profiles.yml` to interface with Databricks
