Project Config
================

The ``cosmos.config.ProjectConfig`` allows you to specify information about where your dbt project is located. It
takes the following arguments:

- ``dbt_project_path`` (required): The full path to your dbt project. This directory should have a ``dbt_project.yml`` file
- ``models_relative_path``: The path to your models directory, relative to the ``dbt_project_path``. This defaults to
  ``models/``
- ``seeds_relative_path``: The path to your seeds directory, relative to the ``dbt_project_path``. This defaults to
  ``data/``
- ``snapshots_relative_path``: The path to your snapshots directory, relative to the ``dbt_project_path``. This defaults
  to ``snapshots/``
- ``manifest_path``: The absolute path to your manifests directory. This is only required if you're using Cosmos' manifest
  parsing mode


Project Config Example

    config = ProjectConfig(
        dbt_project_path="/path/to/dbt/project",
        models_relative_path="models",
        seeds_relative_path="data",
        snapshots_relative_path="snapshots",
        manifest_path="/path/to/manifests",
