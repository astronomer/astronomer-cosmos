Source Nodes Rendering
================

.. note::
    This feature is only available for dbt-core >= 1.5 and cosmos >= 1.6.0.

By default, Cosmos does not render dbt sources automatically. Instead, you need to configure the rendering of sources explicitly.
You can control this behavior using the ``source_rendering_behavior`` field in the ``RenderConfig`` object. This is how it works:

- **all**:
  When set to ``all``, Cosmos renders all sources in the dbt project. It uses three different node types for this:
    - ``EmptyOperator``: For sources that do not have tests or freshness checks.
    - ``DbtSourceOperator``: For sources that have freshness checks.
    - ``DbtTestOperator``: For sources that have tests.

  This approach aims to create a comprehensive DAG that aligns with dbt documentation, allowing for the rendering of both sources and models for a more detailed visual representation.
  It also ensures that model dependencies do not run if their sources are not fresh, thus preventing the execution of stale or incomplete data.

- **none** (default): When set to ``none``, Cosmos does not automatically render any sources. Note that if node converters are being used for sources, they will still function as intended.

- **with_tests_or_freshness**: When set to ``with_tests_or_freshness``, Cosmos only renders sources that have either tests or freshness checks.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from cosmos import DbtTaskGroup, RenderConfig
    from cosmos.constants import SourceRenderingBehavior

    jaffle_shop = DbtTaskGroup(
        render_config=RenderConfig(
            source_rendering_behavior=SourceRenderingBehavior.WITH_TESTS_OR_FRESHNESS,
        )
    )
