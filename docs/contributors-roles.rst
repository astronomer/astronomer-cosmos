Contributors roles
==================

Contributors are welcome and are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and we give credit to them.

This document aims to explain the current roles in the Astronomer Cosmos project.
For more information, check :ref:`contributing` and :ref:`contributors`.


Contributors
------------

A contributor is anyone who wants to contribute code, documentation, tests, ideas, or anything to the Astronomer Cosmos project.

Cosmos contributors can be found in the Astronomer Cosmos Github `insights page <https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos/graphs/contributors>`_ and in the `#airflow-dbt <https://join.slack.com/t/apache-airflow/shared_invite/zt-1zy8e8h85-es~fn19iMzUmkhPwnyRT6Q>`_ Slack channel.

Contributors are responsible for:

* Fixing bugs
* Adding features
* Improving the documentation
* Making/answering questions in the #airflow-dbt Slack channel


Committers/Maintainers
----------------------

Committers are community members with write access to the `Astronomer Cosmos Github repository <https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos>`_.
They can modify the code and the documentation and accept others' contributions to the repo.

Check :ref:`contributors` for the official list of Astronomer Cosmos committers.

Committers have the same responsibilities as standard contributors and also perform the following actions:

* Reviewing & merging pull-requests
* Scanning and responding to GitHub issues, helping triaging them
* Releasing new versions of Cosmos in `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/astronomer-cosmos/>`_, following the `milestones <https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos/milestones>`_.
* Refactoring code
* Improving processes and tooling

If you know you are not going to be able to contribute for a long time (for instance, due to a change of job or circumstances), you should inform other maintainers and we will mark you as "inactive".
Inactive committers will no longer have write access to the repo.
As merit earned never expires, once an inactive committer become active again, they can simply email another maintainer and ask to be reinstated.

Pre-requisites to becoming a committer
