Operators
=========

Cosmos exposes individual operators that correspond to specific dbt commands, which can be used just like traditional
`Apache AirflowÂ® <https://airflow.apache.org/>`_ operators. Cosmos names these operators using the format ``Dbt<dbt-command><execution-mode>Operator``. For example, ``DbtBuildLocalOperator``.

Clone

Requirement

* Cosmos >= 1.8.0

The ``DbtCloneLocalOperator`` implement `dbt clone <https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/commands/clone>`_ command.
