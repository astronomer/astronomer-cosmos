Welcome to Astronomer Cosmos! Whether you're an experienced data practitioner or just getting started, Cosmos makes it
simple to manage and orchestrate your dbt workflows using `Apache Airflow® <https://airflow.apache.org/>`_, saving you
time and effort. By automatically turning dbt workflows into Airflow DAGs, Cosmos allows you to focus on building
high-quality data models without the hassle of managing complex integrations.

To get started right away, please check out our `Quickstart Guides <https://astronomer.github.io/astronomer-cosmos/getting_started/index.html>`_.
You can also explore more examples in `/dev/dags <https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos/tree/main/dev/dags>`_
or in the `cosmos-demo repo <https://github.com/astronomer/cosmos-demo>`_.

To learn more about about Cosmos, please read on.


What Is Astronomer Cosmos?
___________________________

Astronomer Cosmos is an open-source library that bridges Apache Airflow and dbt, allowing you to easily transform your
dbt projects into Airflow DAGs and manage everything seamlessly. With Cosmos, you can write your data transformations
using dbt and then schedule and orchestrate them with Airflow, making the entire process smooth and straightforward.

**Why Cosmos?**  Integrating dbt and Airflow can be complex, but Cosmos simplifies it by seamlessly connecting these
powerful tools—letting you focus on what matters most: delivering impactful data models and results without getting
bogged down by technical challenges.


Why Should You Use Cosmos?
___________________________

Cosmos makes orchestrating dbt workflows:

- **Effortless**: Transform your dbt projects into Airflow DAGs without writing extra code—Cosmos handles the heavy lifting.
- **Reliable**: Rely on Airflow's robust scheduling and monitoring features to ensure your dbt workflows run smoothly and efficiently.
- **Scalable**: Easily scale your workflows to match growing data demands, thanks to Airflow's distributed capabilities.

Whether you're handling intricate data tasks or looking to streamline your processes, Cosmos helps you orchestrate dbt
with Airflow effortlessly, saving you time and letting you focus on what truly matters—creating impactful insights.


Example Usage: Jaffle Shop Project
__________________________________

Let's explore a practical example to see how Cosmos can convert the dbt workflow into an Airflow DAG.

The `jaffle_shop project <https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop>`_ is a sample dbt project that simulates an e-commerce store's data.
The project includes a series of dbt models that transform raw data into structured tables, such as sales, customers, and products.

Below, you can see what the original dbt workflow looks like in a lineage graph. This graph helps illustrate the
relationships between different models:

Cosmos can take this dbt workflow and convert it into an Airflow DAG, allowing you to leverage Airflow's scheduling and
orchestration capabilities.

To convert this dbt workflow into an Airflow DAG, create a new DAG definition file, import ``DbtDag`` from the Cosmos library,
and fill in a few parameters, such as the dbt project directory path and the profile name:

..
   The following renders in Sphinx but not Github:

.. literalinclude:: ./../dev/dags/basic_cosmos_dag.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START local_example]
    :end-before: [END local_example]


This code snippet will generate an Airflow DAG that looks like this:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos/main/docs/_static/jaffle_shop_dag.png

``DbtDag`` is a custom DAG generator that converts dbt projects into Airflow DAGs and accepts Cosmos-specific args like
``fail_fast`` to immediately fail a dag if dbt fails to process a resource, or ``cancel_query_on_kill`` to cancel any running
queries if the task is externally killed or manually set to failed in Airflow. ``DbtDag`` also accepts standard DAG arguments such
as ``max_active_tasks``, ``max_active_runs`` and ``default_args``.

With Cosmos, transitioning from a dbt workflow to a proper Airflow DAG is seamless, giving you the best of both tools
for managing and scaling your data workflows.
