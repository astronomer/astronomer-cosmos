Run your dbt Core projects as `Apache Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/>`_ DAGs and Task Groups with a few lines of code. Benefits include:

- Run dbt projects against Airflow connections instead of dbt profiles
- Native support for installing and running dbt in a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts with Airflow
- Run tests immediately after a model is done to catch issues early
- Utilize Airflow's data-aware scheduling to run models immediately after upstream ingestion
- Turn each dbt model into a task/task group complete with retries, alerting, etc.


Example Usage
___________________

You can render a Cosmos Airflow DAG using the ``DbtDag`` class. Here's an example with the `jaffle_shop project <https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop>`_:

..
   The following renders in Sphinx but not Github:

.. literalinclude:: ./dev/dags/basic_cosmos_dag.py
    :language: python
    :start-after: [START local_example]
    :end-before: [END local_example]


This will generate an Airflow DAG that looks like this:
