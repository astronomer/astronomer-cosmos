PostgresUserPassword
====================



    Maps Airflow Postgres connections using user + password authentication to dbt profiles.

    https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-setups/postgres-setup

    https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-postgres/stable/connections/postgres.html



This profile mapping translates Airflow connections with the type ``postgres``
into dbt profiles. To use this profile, import it from ``cosmos.profiles``:

.. code-block:: python

    from cosmos.profiles import PostgresUserPasswordProfileMapping

    profile = PostgresUserPasswordProfileMapping(
        conn_id="my_postgres_connection",
        profile_args={...},
    )

While the profile mapping pulls fields from Airflow connections, you may need to supplement it
with additional ``profile_args``. The below table shows which fields are required, along with those
not required but pulled from the Airflow connection if present. You can also add additional fields
to the ``profile_args`` dict.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - dbt Field Name
     - Required
     - Airflow Field Name


   * - ``host``
     - True

     - ``host``


   * - ``user``
     - True

     - ``login``


   * - ``password``
     - True

     - ``password``


   * - ``port``
     - True

     - ``port``


   * - ``dbname``
     - True

     - ``schema``


   * - ``keepalives_idle``
     - False

     - ``extra.keepalives_idle``


   * - ``sslmode``
     - False

     - ``extra.sslmode``


   * - ``schema``
     - True

Some notes about the table above:

- This table doesn't necessarily show the full list of fields you *can* pass to the dbt profile. To
  see the full list of fields, see the link to the dbt docs at the top of this page.
- If the Airflow field name starts with an ``extra.``, this means that the field is nested under
  the ``extra`` field in the Airflow connection. For example, if the Airflow field name is
  ``extra.token``, this means that the field is nested under ``extra`` in the Airflow connection,
  and the field name is ``token``.
- If there are multiple Airflow field names, the profile mapping looks at those fields in order.
  For example, if the Airflow field name is ``['password', 'extra.token']``, the profile mapping
  will first look for a field named ``password``. If that field is not present, it will look for
  ``extra.token``.
