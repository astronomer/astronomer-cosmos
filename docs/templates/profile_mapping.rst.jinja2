{{ mapping_description }}

This profile mapping translates Airflow connections with the type ``{{ airflow_conn_type }}``
into dbt profiles. To use this profile, import it from ``cosmos.profiles``:

.. code-block:: python

    from cosmos.profiles import {{ mapping_name }}ProfileMapping

    profile = {{ mapping_name }}ProfileMapping(
        conn_id = 'my_{{ airflow_conn_type }}_connection',
        profile_args = { ... },
    )

While the profile mapping pulls fields from Airflow connections, you may need to supplement it
with additional ``profile_args``. The below table shows which fields are required, along with those
not required but pulled from the Airflow connection if present. You can also add additional fields
to the ``profile_args`` dict.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - dbt Field Name
     - Required
     - Airflow Field Name

   {% for field in fields %}
   * - ``{{ field.dbt_name }}``
     - {{ field.required }}
    {% if field.airflow_name %}
     - ``{{ field.airflow_name }}``
    {% else %}
     -
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}


Some notes about the table above:

- This table doesn't necessarily show the full list of fields you *can* pass to the dbt profile. To
  see the full list of fields, see the link to the dbt docs at the top of this page.
- If the Airflow field name starts with an ``extra.``, this means that the field is nested under
  the ``extra`` field in the Airflow connection. For example, if the Airflow field name is
  ``extra.token``, this means that the field is nested under ``extra`` in the Airflow connection,
  and the field name is ``token``.
- If there are multiple Airflow field names, the profile mapping looks at those fields in order.
  For example, if the Airflow field name is ``['password', 'extra.token']``, the profile mapping
  will first look for a field named ``password``. If that field is not present, it will look for
  ``extra.token``.
{% if profile_defaults %}

Default Values
--------------

This profile mapping sets the following default values. These can be overridden by passing
them in ``profile_args``.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field Name
     - Default Value

   {% for key, value in profile_defaults.items() %}
   * - ``{{ key }}``
     - ``{{ value }}``
   {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
